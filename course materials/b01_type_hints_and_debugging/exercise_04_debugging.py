# Write a short program to square some the numbers
# from one to five and print them out.
# The program should contain a for loop and a range.
# You can square a number either by multiplying it by itself,
# or using **2
#
# Run it using right click then Run.
#
# Once it runs successfully, add a debug
# point on the line with the print statement,
# then debug it by clicking on the debug icon
# and repeatedly pressing F8.
# You should see the value of the variable change.
