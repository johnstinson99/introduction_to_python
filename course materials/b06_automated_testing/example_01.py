# Alt + Insert to create a new file
# Choose Python File, then Choose
# Kind -> Python Unit Test from the pull-down list box

# The file name must start with the word 'test' to be
# picked up by the test runner.
#
# Start by testing 'abc'.upper() == 'ABC'
#
# Tips:
#   Make numpy random numbers predictable using:
#   np.random.seed(0)
#
#   Test large units of code. Small units are likely to work.
#
#   Test edge cases: boundary conditions, incorrect types, large numbers
#
#   Test driven development (Red -> Green -> Refactor)
#
#   Simulate data to lock it down. Don't rely on data from an API
